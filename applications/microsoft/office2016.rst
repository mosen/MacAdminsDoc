Office 2016 for Mac

Changing the Name and Initials
------------------------------

If you deployed Office 2016 with a volume license, chances are your user will complain that the name used for reviews (or Auto-Track changes) is "Microsoft Office User" with initials "MO" (or any localized variation).

It is stored here : `~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/MeContact.plist`

example::

    minidefrancois:~ fti$ defaults read "/Users/fti/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/MeContact.plist"
    {
        Initials = FTI;
        Name = "Francois Levaux-Tiffreau";
    }


How to script it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A simple script that sets both the Office 2016 Name and Initials values in the MeContact.plist for the currently logged in user::

    #!/bin/bash
    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/libexec
    export PATH
    
    FullScriptName=$(basename "$0") # Variable used to store the file name of this script
    
    DsclSearchPath="/Local/Default" # Variable used to store the search path used by the dscl command.
    
    # Get the username of the person currently running the script.
    username=$(id -un)
    
    echo "$FullScriptName -- Personalizing Office 2016 for $username"
    
    # Lookup the user's name from the local directory
    firstname=$(dscl "$DsclSearchPath" -read /Users/$username RealName | tr -d '\n' | awk '{print $2}')
    lastname=$(dscl "$DsclSearchPath" -read /Users/$username RealName | tr -d '\n' | awk '{print $3}')
    
    # Get the first letter for the initial
    firstInitial=${firstname:0:1}
    
    # Get the first letter for the initial
    lastInitial=${lastname:0:1}
    
    # Concatenate the initials together into one variable.
    UserInitials="$(echo $firstInitial$lastInitial)"
    
    # Concatenate the full name together into one variable.
    UserFullName="$(echo $firstname $lastname)"
    
    # Remove any leading or trailing whitepace
    UserFullName="$(echo -e "${UserFullName}" | sed -e 's/^[[:space:]]//' -e 's/[[:space:]]$//')"
    UserInitials="$(echo -e "${UserInitials}" | sed -e 's/^[[:space:]]//' -e 's/[[:space:]]$//')"
    
    defaults write "/Users/$username/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/MeContact.plist" Name "$UserFullName"
    
    defaults write "/Users/$username/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/MeContact.plist" Initials "$UserInitials"
    
    echo "$FullScriptName -- Completed personalizing Office 2016 for $username"
    
    # Quit the script without errors.
    exit 0

Deploying Office Templates
--------------------------

It's technically possible to deploy your templates in `~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content.localized/Templates.localized`, 
but unfortunately this container won't exist until the user launches an Office application. There's a better way.

Simply drop your templates in `/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office365/User Content.localized/Templates.localized` to get them avaiable for all users at any time. 
They will be available to the user in `File > New from Template…`. 

You can also create subfolders (won't change display). 
As they're directly referenced, any change to this folder will be reflected in Office (they're not copied).

How to script it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can either create a package to deploy the templates at the right place, or use this script to create the directories::

    # This script checks for and creates if needed the directories for Office 2016 templates for Word, PowerPoint and Excel
    # Made by Rich-the-Great
    
    function test_command {
        "$@"
        local status=$?
        /bin/echo -n "Executing '$@'… "
        if [ $status -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "ERROR: $@" >&2
            exit $status
        fi
        echo "OK"
    
    }
    
    if [[ ! -d "/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office365/User Content.localized/Templates.localized" ]]; then
       /bin/echo "Necessary support directories for Office 2016 templates not found."
       /bin/echo "Creating necessary support directories for Office 2016 templates."
       
       test_command /bin/mkdir -p "/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office365/User Content.localized/Templates.localized"
       
       # We don't use -R to make sure we don't step on anybody's shoe
       # On a fresh 15.19.1 install, perms are root:wheel 755
       test_command /usr/sbin/chown root:wheel "/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office365"
       test_command /usr/sbin/chown root:wheel "/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office365/User Content.localized"
       test_command /usr/sbin/chown root:wheel "/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office365/User Content.localized/Templates.localized"
       test_command /bin/chmod 755 "/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office365"
       test_command /bin/chmod 755 "/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office365/User Content.localized"
       test_command /bin/chmod 755 "/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office365/User Content.localized/Templates.localized"
    fi
