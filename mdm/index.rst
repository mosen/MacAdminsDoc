Mobile Device Management
========================

Mobile Device Management refers to a number of different products which can manage your macOS, tvOS, and iOS devices
through the use of the `MDM protocol <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/MobileDeviceManagementProtocolRef/1-Introduction/Introduction.html>`_ and
Configuration Profiles.

This is the Apple officially sanctioned way to manage your devices, although there are many other options for macOS.
