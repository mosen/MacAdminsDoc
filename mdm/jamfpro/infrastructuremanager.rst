    JAMF Infrastructure Manager


Your JAMF Infrastructure Manager server should sit in the DMZ and should only be able to talk with the correct port of your LDAP server.
It should be reachable from Internet at the port you'll specify in the JSS.

Prerequisites
-------------

Please read the `Administrator Manual <http://docs.jamfsoftware.com/9.93/casper-suite/administrator-guide/Infrastructure_Manager_Instances.html>`_ first.

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You'll need to download and setup Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I won't cover this here.

I use Microsoft Azure for test purposes.

Firewall settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Internal Network <-> DMZ**

Infrastructure Manager Server should be able to reach:

- the LDAP server (389, 636 or 3268)
- your internal DNS server
- your internal NTP server if available

**DMZ <-> Internet**

Infrastructure manager should be able to reach

- your JSS (port 8443 usually)

Infrastructure manager needs to be reached on the port you'll set later. Choose a port > 1024.

Consult `Permitting Inbound/Outbound Traffic with JAMF Cloud <https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/article.html?id=409>`_ for more information.

Java 1.8
^^^^^^^^

In an ideal world, you should download Java from `Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>`_. Or better, you shouldn't use Java.

I found the best way to install Oracle Java 1.8 is doing the following::

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

You'll have to access Oracle's License to proceed.

As this is a third-party repository, use it with caution, and only on test instances. If you found a better way, please :doc:`contributing`!

Test with ``java -version`` to see if it works::

    $ java -version
    java version "1.8.0_101"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_101-b13)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.101-b13, mixed mode)

JAMF Infrastructure Manager package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Connect to JAMF Nation
2. Go to `My Assets <https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/myAssets.html>`_.
3. Download Infrastructure Manager
4. Upload it to your Linux server

I use ``scp`` to upload the binary to my server::

    cd ~/Downloads
    scp jamf-im_1.0.0-0_all.deb fti@13.93.87.150:

Configuring
-----------

Create the correct user in JSS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a Standard User that has only "Infrastructure Manager" role.

.. figure:: img/jamf-im-1.png
   :alt: Account


.. figure:: img/jamf-im-2.png
   :alt: Privileges


Launch the setup assistant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By installing the package, you'll launch the setup assistant::

    sudo dpkg -i jamf-im_1.0.0-0_all.deb


Enter the host for your cloud instance:

.. figure:: img/jamf-im-sa-5.png
   :alt: Cloud Instance Host

Enter the login and password you created earlier:

.. figure:: img/jamf-im-sa-4.png
   :alt: Enter the infrastructure manager login

.. figure:: img/jamf-im-sa-3.png
   :alt: Enter the infrastructure manager password

Enter the public IP Address of your Infrastructure Manager server:

.. figure:: img/jamf-im-sa-2.png
   :alt: Enter the public IP address of your infrastructure manager server

Setup the frequency. I use the default value of 30 seconds:

.. figure:: img/jamf-im-sa-1.png
   :alt: Set up the frequency

If everything goes well, you should see the following::

   Enrollment invitation stored.
   Successfully obtained enrollment invitation from https://ftiff.jamfcloud.com

Create a LDAP Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's all downhill for now. Just kidding. This is the tricky part, as LDAP can be difficult to configure. We won't cover LDAP configuration here.

1. Open JSS
2. Go to System Settings > LDAP Servers
3. Add a LDAP Server
4. Choose "Configure Manually"
5. Choose "Enable LDAP Proxy Server"

Make sure you choose the right port number. It should be >1024 and be reachable from internet to your public IP address.

Troubleshooting

Log files
^^^^^^^^^

Log files are located here:

- /var/log/jamf-im-launcher.log
- /var/log/jamf-im.log

LDAP Server needs authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Log message::

Infrastructure Manager cannot bind to address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This error might happen if your server is not bound to a public address (if ``ip show add`` doesn't show the public address).
This happens if you create a NAT to map a public IP address to a private IP.

I haven't found the solution for this one yet. It seems that JAMF haven't thought of this use case.
