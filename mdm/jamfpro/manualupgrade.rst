Upgrade JSS, the Manual way
===========================

Disclaimer
----------

I'm just listing what I usually do to upgrade JSS. If you have a better idea, please :doc:`contribute`_! 

Please first test on a test JSS.

Backup, Backup, Backup!
-----------------------

Make sure you have a working backup before doing anything. 
I use the following command::

    java -jar /usr/local/jss/bin/JSSDatabaseUtil.jar backup -saveBackupTo ~/ -server jamf-mysql1.sdfsfsaa111.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com -pass
    
This will save the backup in your user home folder. Send it to another computer.

In general, please follow this article: `Preparing to Upgrade the JSS <https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/article.html?id=136>`_.

Prepare the JSS Installer
-------------------------

Download the JSS Installer from JAMF Nation. 

1. Connect to JAMF Nation
2. Go to `My Assets <https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/myAssets.html>`_.
3. Click "Show JSS installer downloads"
4. Download JSS Manual Installation
5. Upload it to your Linux box
6. Unzip it, and you're ready to go!

.. NOTE:: 
    I usually upload it to my Distribution Point, and get it from my Ubuntu server using:
    ``curl https://login:password@dp-1.fti.io/JSS_Installers/JSSInstallation9.93.zip --digest -k -O``

Upgrade JSS
-----------

If you have a Clustered JSS, please read `Upgrading the JSS in a Clustered Environment <https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/article.html?id=212>`_. 

First, let's stop the JSS::

    service jamf.tomcat7 stop

Then archive the current install to ``~/ROOT-war-20160830.tgz``::

    tar czf ~/ROOT-war-20160830.tgz /usr/local/jss/tomcat/webapps/
    rm -rf /usr/local/jss/tomcat/webapps/*

Copy the new ROOT.war and restart tomcat::

    mv JSSInstallation/JSS\ Components/ROOT.war /usr/local/jss/tomcat/webapps/
    service jamf.tomcat7 start

Just reconfigure the database, and everything should be working again!

If something goes wrong
-----------------------

Read the logs in ``/usr/local/jss/tomcat/logs/``. 
Worst case, restore from backup and use the Linux automatic updater.
